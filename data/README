HEADER.

The requirements of this format are:
* Each value has to be separated from the next one by a comma ','
* At the top of the file, there's a HEADER with the next specifications:
  a) 1st row -- This row, shows the use of each column, that is, if it's 'bout
                features data (D) or classes (C). It starts and ends with @
                symbol

     @D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D ... D D C C ... C@

  b) 2nd row -- This row, shows the type of each, if it's discreet data (D) or
                continuous data (C). It starts and ends with # symbol.

     #D C C C C C C C D D D D C D C D C ... D C D D ... D@
